# Bamazon
## A simple node.js terminal app that emulates an online shopping framework.

### In the bamazonCustomer.js file you can act as a simple customer and purchase items from the list provided.

### In the bamazonManager.js file you can be the manager and view what items are in stock and if inventory is low you can add either to a single product or add a whole new product all together.

### **Bamazon Customer:**

#### You will see a prompt to buy something and all you have to do is insert that items id number, and the quantity that you want.


### **Bamazon Manager:**

#### There will be four prompts:
 `1. Allows you to see all the products and their information.` 
 
 `2. Allows you to view products that have a low inventory.` 

 `3. Allows you to add to the inventory of a particular product.`

 `4. Allows you to add a totaly new product.`

 ### Looking at the images in the `how-to-images` folder will prove helpful.
